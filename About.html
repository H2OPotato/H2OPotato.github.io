            <h4>Boise State’s chess club opens to new and returning players</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>Boise State University’s chess club makes chess accessible to both new players and skilled veterans.

Chess gained immense online popularity during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to safety regulations, players had to stick to online games until recently. The chess club on campus offers a great way to play over-the-board games.

Senior electrical engineering major and club president Ty Pfost reestablished the club in September 2021. Since then, it has grown to over 40 members of all different skill levels. 

“We basically have everyone from every rating level,” said sophomore political science major Diego Cowmey. “We have people who’ve never played before and just want to get better, and we have full-on experts.”

The club pushes to be beginner friendly and have in-person meetings that serve as a social experience, which encourages new and returning members to learn, experiment and improve, according to Pfost.

Senior elementary education major Ashley Hardy says she enjoys her time at club meetings for this reason. She mentioned trying out crazy moves that often cause her to lose the game.

“I’m one of the players that play for fun,” Hardy said. “We help people learn by going through different strategies, talking about different openings and working on endings, and just playing together because you learn more as you play.”

The club is very beginner friendly. Pfost says everyone is willing to teach and play newcomers.

“We especially want people to try out the game and learn how to play because it is intimidating,” Pfost said. “People always associate it with intellect and knowledge, but it just comes down to practice.” 

A common misconception about chess is that it’s “very mathematical,” as Cowmey put it. The truth is, there’s a variety of ways to play.

“Chess for me is like a good argument. You’re constantly questioning your opponent’s play and asking questions about their position and they’re asking questions about yours,” Cowmey said.

Cowmey is one of the more experienced players that enjoys competing. Recently the club entered Chess.com’s North American Collegiate Esports league (NACE) tournament, a competition for college clubs around the country.

Pfost says the club hopes to do more online and in-person tournaments in the future for players who like to compete.

For now, Boise State’s chess club is looking for anyone and everyone that is interested in chess. The members say that one of the best parts about the club is the new people and experiences it offers.

“I think over-the-board, in-person games [are] the best way to find enjoyment in the game,” Pfost said. “Having someone to talk to, seeing their actual face, commentating on the game, messing around a little bit is just a great way to get better, and to meet people and to experience the game in a whole new way.”

There are plenty of interesting stories about the history of chess that the members share during the meetings too.

“For example, there’s an opening in chess called the orangutan opening which got its name from a grand master who went to a zoo and had a monkey, apparently, play a move for him, and that’s how that opening gets its name,” Cowmey said.

The future looks bright for members of this young club. They are excited to be here hanging out and playing chess at Boise State. 

“On Friday nights I could do anything else,” Pfost said. “I could go to parties or hang with my other friends, but I actually want to be at the [chess] club.” 

The club meets in the Bronco Lounge inside the Student Union Building, behind Subway on Wednesdays at 6 p.m. and Fridays at 7 p.m. and has a Chess.com page.

            <h4>Boise State men’s rugby is chasing a championship in 2022</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>The Boise State men’s rugby club is kicking off their 2022 season. They had a great season last fall, and it’s only going to get better this year.

                Ranked fourth in the nation, the team has one goal in mind: rise above last year’s loss to Virginia Tech in the semifinals and become D1AA Champions. 
                
                The team is coming off of an undefeated regular season last fall, during which they made it into the playoffs but were eliminated in the second round after they ran into health and endurance issues.
                
                “We were up 10-11 [points] at half. We lost about eight starters at half due to injury, which was not good for us,” said senior integrated media and strategic communications major and team captain, Kyle Curry. “We lost, and that team went on to win the trophy.”
                
                Despite this loss, Curry felt that the Broncos could’ve been in the No. 1 spot.
                
                It’s a new year and a new season for Bronco rugby, and the players are confident in the work they put in during the offseason.
                
                The team implemented a rigorous offseason workout program and acquired new members to the coaching staff over the summer, according to senior marketing major Brandon Besler. 
                
                One of these coaches is three-time collegiate All-American, Nartus Wessels.
                
                “We got a new coach, and he definitely brings more rugby IQ and a different look on how we play rugby,” said senior business administration major Bennett Mantz.
                
                One of the team’s biggest strengths this year is its returning talent including Curry and Mantz, who were named scholastic All-Americans by National Collegiate Rugby.
                
                “I think in general we’re just very technically skilled compared to other teams, and we’ve got [a] really high IQ which really helps us out,” Besler said. “We’re not always the biggest team, but we usually can beat teams due to being better at the fundamentals and just more skilled.” 
                
                This season is shaping up to be something special for the club. Years of hard work have brought the team to where it is today. 
                
                Not long ago, Bronco Rugby was more of a “social club,” according to Besler. 
                
                The rugby club was reestablished in 2006 and used to be known as the Boise State Fighting Flamingos, according to Curry.
                
                “They wore these bright pink jerseys,” Curry said. “We’re going to pay homage to those coaches and players by debuting the pink jerseys this season at a couple of home games as a little bit of a throwback.”
                
                The team has since found their new identity. When many of the team’s seniors were freshmen, they won only two games out of nine. Now, the club has only lost two games in the last two years.

                Many veteran players have dedicated their time after class to building a blue-collar culture that is focused on winning, according to Curry.
                
                The team is not financially supported by the university unlike some of the teams they play against, like Nazareth College in Rochester. According to Mantz, Besler and Curry, this puts an extra chip on their shoulder.
                
                “When we found out Nazareth was varsity, we knew there was no holding back,” Curry said. “We like to think of ourselves as a blue-collar team. When we played Nazareth, we beat them 46-19, and they were all scholarship athletes and we were not.”
                
                It’s championship or bust for the club. The team says they want to leave a legacy behind and build rugby culture around Boise State. 
                
                “Last year was the farthest our club’s ever gotten,” Besler said. “To leave on a high note, being a champion and leave that legacy behind as the first champions in Boise State history, it would be amazing.” 
                
                The club says that winning a championship would not only mean a lot to the university, but to Idaho as well. 
                
                “It would be a symbol of how far we came, and if we won it would feel like something we definitely worked for and deserved,” Curry said.
                
                The team hopes to have lots of fan support this year and have made admission to their games free of charge. 
                
                “I hope that people come to the games because it means a lot to us,” Mantz said. “Having fan support there definitely keeps us that much more motivated.”
                
                Boise State men’s rugby kicks off its first week in Pullman, Washington, against the Washington State Cougars. The team will play its first home game against Gonzaga University on Oct. 1 on the Lincoln Turf Field.</p>
